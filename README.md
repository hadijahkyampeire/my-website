This project is configured for automatic deployment to AWS S3 and CloudFront using AWS CodePipeline.

### Prerequisites

1. An S3 bucket configured for static website hosting
2. A CloudFront distribution pointing to your S3 bucket
3. AWS CodeBuild service role with appropriate permissions

### Required Environment Variables

Set these environment variables in your CodeBuild project:

- `S3_BUCKET_NAME`: Your S3 bucket name (e.g., `my-portfolio-website`)
- `CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID`: Your CloudFront distribution ID

### CodeBuild Service Role Permissions

Your CodeBuild service role needs the following permissions:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME",

      "Action": ["cloudfront:CreateInvalidation"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:cloudfront::*:distribution/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Pipeline Setup
